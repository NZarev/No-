1.Import Scanner for Input:
  Import java.util.Scanner to enable reading user input.
2.Define Main Class and Method:
  Create the class No.
  In the main method, create a Scanner instance to read user input.
3.Read Array Size n:
  Read an integer n which specifies the size of the array (number of elements).
4.Declare and Initialize Variables:
  Create an integer array numbers of size n to store the numbers.
  Initialize totalSum to zero. This will hold the sum of all numbers.
5.Read Numbers and Calculate Total Sum:
  Use a for loop to:
    Read each number and store it in the numbers array.
    Add each number to totalSum.
6.Initialize found Flag for Result Checking:
  Create a boolean found, set initially to false. This will help determine if a number equal to the sum of the other numbers is found.
7.Check if Any Number Equals the Sum of the Other Numbers:
  Use an enhanced for loop to iterate over each num in numbers.
    For each num, check if it equals totalSum - num (i.e., if removing num from totalSum leaves a value equal to num itself).
    If this condition is met:
      Print "Yes" and "Sum = " followed by num.
      Set found to true and break out of the loop.
8.Handle Case When No Matching Sum Is Found:
  If no such number is found (found is false):
    Find the largest number in numbers using another enhanced for loop.
    Calculate the difference diff as the absolute value of maxNum - (totalSum - maxNum).
    Print "No" and "Diff = " followed by diff.
9.Close the Scanner:
  Use scanner.close() to release the resource
